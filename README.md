# Real-Time Face Recognition using DeepFace

This project is a simple Python script that uses [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) and OpenCV to perform real-time face recognition via webcam. It compares the webcam feed with a reference image and displays whether the detected face matches the reference image.

## 🖼️ Demo

The app displays a webcam feed with text indicating whether the current face matches the reference image:

- ✅ **MATCH!** — Face detected matches the reference.
- ❌ **NO MATCH!** — Face detected does not match the reference.
